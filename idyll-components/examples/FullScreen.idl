[FullScreen]
  [MyCustomComponent /]
[/FullScreen]

This is useful to use in conjunction with the [Feature] component
to get fullscreen background images:
[Feature]
  [Feature.Content]
    [FullScreen backgroundImage:"background-image.jpg"  /]
  [/Feature.Content]

  Anything else you put here will scroll by. The
  component will unlock after all of this content here has been shown.
